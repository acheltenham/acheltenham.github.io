Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Antonio, a seasoned Staff Security Engineer known for crafting elegant solutions to complex challenges. Originally from the vibrant island of Barbados, I bring over 20 years of invaluable experience to the ever-evolving technology landscape. 

With an extensive background spanning over six dynamic years at Shopify, I've worn multiple hatsâ€”evolving from a Security Developer to a Senior Engineering Program Manager in Identity and Access Management. My role as a Staff Security Engineer immerses me in the dynamic realms of I.T., Security, and intricate data problem-solving.

Beyond security, I'm an earnest advocate of entrepreneurship and a skilled problem solver through software development. Additionally, I find joy in woodworking and the art of home improvement, where I channel my creativity through hands-on work.
